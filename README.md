QGIS Natural Earth Raster
=========================

A GQIS plugin which makes it easy to add Natural Earth raster data to your projects.

This plugin is based on the template provided by the [Plugin Builder](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/pluginbuilder/) QGIS plugin.

The only theme not supported by this plugin is the 1:50m bathymetry layer. It is a layered Photoshop file which requires postprocessing before it can be used with QGIS.
